            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <p>We are committed to providing students with a structured English language learning programme<br> 
                so that each student can reach their full potential <br>
                in a stimulating, rewarding and safe environment.

            <h3>Our Approach</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <p>We believe students learn most effectively when they are engaged, motivated and challenged. <br>
                We recognise that each student learns and develops at different rates so our courses respect each student’s developmental stage.<br>
                Our teachers use a range of age-appropriate techniques and resources to ensure the most effective language learning experience.<br>
                We expect our students to take an active role in their own learning and reflect on their progress.<br> 
                Our approach covers all aspects of communication with an emphasis on developing confidence in speaking to equip students <br>
                with the English they will need for future academic study, employment and social situations.<br>
                Children at this age benefit from established class routines and are capable of longer periods of concentration in a classroom setting.
                <br>Learners are still developing concepts, literacy and numeracy in their first language and our carefully selected English course content supports this.
