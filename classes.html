            <h3>IELTS Courses</h3>
            <p>The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) measures the language proficiency of people who want to study or work where English is used as a language of communication.<br>
            It uses a nine-band scale to clearly identify levels of proficiency, from non-user (band score 1) through to expert (band score 9).<br>
            IELTS is available in two test versions: Academic - for people applying for higher education or professional registration, <br>
            and General Training for those migrating to Australia, Canada and the UK, <br>
            or applying for secondary education, training programmes and work experience in an English-speaking environment.<br>
            Both versions provide a valid and accurate assessment of the four language skills: listening, reading, writing and speaking. <br>
            Our English for IELTS courses are specially designed to optimise your test potential.<br>
            With no more than 3 participants on each course, you will get individual attention from your teacher and advice on how to approach each section of the test.<br>
            On this course you will study the four skills assessed in the IELTS exam:  speaking, listening, reading and writing.<br>
            You will also receive expert feedback from your teacher on how to best develop your English grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary.<br>
            Our English for IELTS (Intensive) course helps you quickly develop skills and strategies needed to improve your IELTS band score. <br>
            The course is designed for learners who plan to take the exam in the near future.<br><br>

        The introductory program is open to beginners with little formal teacher training, proficiency certificate holders and university students or graduates of English, while the advanced level course is aimed at relatively experienced teachers. <br>
        The programs offer participants a solid grounding in current approaches to teaching English as a foreign language, with an emphasis on practical applications in classroom settings. <br>
        The advanced program is aimed at teachers with some classroom experience who wish to enhance their teaching effectiveness, as well as those teachers who seek practical experience and new ideas for creative second language training. <br>
        Participants in the advanced level course acquire a deeper understanding of both the theory and practice of teaching English as a foreign language.<br>
        Building on the participants’ prior knowledge of the standard components of an introductory TEFL program, the advanced program addresses more specialized areas of the field such as<br>
